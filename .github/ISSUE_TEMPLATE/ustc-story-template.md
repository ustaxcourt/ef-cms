## Story Definition of Ready (Created on 9/26/21)
The following criteria must be met in order for the user story to be picked up by the Flexion development team.
The user story must: 
- [ ]  Be immediately actionable for the development team
- [ ]  Be focused on users
- [ ]  Include a narrative. “As a ____, so that I can ______, I need _____.”
- [ ]  Include user-centric acceptance criteria that expresses the users' needs
- [ ]  Include user-centric testing scenarios
- [ ]  Include preconditions (story dependencies)
- [ ]  Not include design or technical solutions
- [ ]  Include non-standard testing, deployment, documentation, browser, mobile or security requirements, as well as any requirements for 3rd-party integrations

Process: Flexion developers and designers will test if the story meets acceptance criteria and test cases in Flexion dev and staging environments (“standard testing”). If additional acceptance criteria or testing scenarios are discovered while the story is in progress, a new story should be created, added to the backlog and prioritized by the product owner.
