# How We Work

## Tools

-   GitHub: We use our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms) for storing both software and collaboratively-maintained text.
-   ZenHub: We use the vendor's [ZenHub organization](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms#workspaces/ef-cms-5bbe4bed4b5806bc2bec65d3/boards?repos=152320868&showPipelineDescriptions=false) for storing the product backlog.
-   Zoom: We use both the Court's and vendor's Zoom accounts for video teleconferences.
-   Slack: We use both the Court's and vendor's Slack for communication that falls outside of the structure of GitHub or ZenHub, but that doesn't rise to the level of email, or for communication that it's helpful for everybody else to be able to observe. Notable channels include:
    - #ustcproject — Main project channel. Used to communicate high-level messages re: project
    - #ustc-story-channel — Channel used to communicate story-related work.
    - #ustcux — Design/research-specific channel.
    - #ustctech — Tech-specific channel.

## Meetings

There are two basic meeting rhythms: daily design calls/standups and bi-weekly agile sprint rituals. All meetings are held via video teleconference. A telephone bridge is maintained as a backup method of connecting, but participants are strongly encouraged to join via video.

### Daily

- **Daily design sync** — this meeting is a time to solution functionality, demo in-progress work with the team and review new wireframes
- **Daily standup**

### Weekly

- **Stakeholder meeting** — on Mondays and Fridays, we review the current project status with stakeholders at the Court and discuss the schedule of large releases that need off-hours deployments

### Bi-weekly

- **Sprint review prep** — Every other Monday
- **Sprint review** — Every other Tuesday, demo to client stakeholders
- **Sprint retrospective** — Every other Tuesday
- **Sprint planning** — Every other Wednesday
- **Backlog grooming** — As needed

## Product Team

There is a cross functional product team for the U.S. Tax Court case management system, comprised of business, policy, security, procurement and technical specialists who are working together to move the entire enterprise forward towards its goals. This product team is comprised of the following roles:

-   Product owner: U.S. Tax Court
-   Technical lead: U.S. Tax Court
-   User Experience designer: vendor
-   Visual designer: vendor
-   Researcher: vendor
-   Developers (Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack): vendor
-   Scrum Master: vendor

This team will participate in all scrum ceremonies in service of prioritizing, defining and delivering value to the Court and the stakeholders it serves.

## Design Research

We recognize that the Court staff and members of the public will be critical to helping us develop solutions that will deliver better service to petitioners, practitioners, and Court staff. We continuously perform observational research and usability testing, and create lightweight prototypes, to iterate on designs and develop a system that meets end-user needs.

## Making Code Changes

### Definition of Done

There are two checklists that define what "done" is for [user stories](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ustc-story-template.md) and [bug fixes](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

### Accepting Vendor Work

Acceptance of work happens through the sprint as work is completed.

#### User stories and new features

1.  Development team completes work starting from the `staging` environment — see _Definition of Done_ above
2.  The product team verifies the functionality against acceptance criteria in the Court's `migration` environment
3.  Development team creates pull request to the Court's `staging` environment
4.  The code is reviewed by the Court for compliance with the contract's [performance and deliverable standards](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq/blob/master/02_SOW.md#deliverables-and-performance-standards), and for general technical quality — see [Code Review Process](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/docs/code-review.md)
5.  The development team responds to the Court’s code review feedback
6.  Pull request merged to staging branch and deployed to the staging environment by the Court
7.  User testing is performed
8.  Court creates pull request to production branch and merges to update the production environment

#### Bug fixes

1.  Development team completes work starting from the `staging` environment — see _Definition of Done_ above
2.  The product team verifies the functionality against acceptance criteria in the Court's `test` environment
3.  Development team creates pull request to the Court's `staging` environment
4.  The code is reviewed by the Court for compliance with the contract's [performance and deliverable standards](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq/blob/master/02_SOW.md#deliverables-and-performance-standards), and for general technical quality — see [Code Review Process](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/docs/code-review.md)

### Testing Strategy

The testing strategy is documented in [./docs](./docs).

### Code Review Process

Documented in [our Code Review Process](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/docs/code-review.md).


## Principles

Our basic principles drive team decision-making.

1.  **Build using agile and iterative practices.** We use iterative software development to deliver features to users and reduce risk.

2.  **Understand what people need.** We practice human-centered design to inform technical and design decisions. We continually explore and pinpoint the needs of the people who use the service and build functionality to meet their needs. We design an intuitive system that allows users to succeed the first time, unaided, and follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service.

3.  **Own and manage our data.** We ensure that all Court data remains in the Court's care, custody, and control.

4.  **Own and manage our software.** We retain control over our mission-critical custom software, ensuring portability and flexibility by using service-oriented architecture.

5.  **Default to open.** We build secure, open source software, creating and maintaining it in public repositories, where it may be inspected by the public who places their trust in it, and where it is available for use by other courts.

6.  **Build atop a modern technology stack.** We use cloud-based hosting infrastructure, modular software frameworks, containerization, and automated testing to increase efficiency, allow the team to work effectively, and scale the service on demand.

7.  **Favor emergent architecture over "big up-front design."** Consistent with agile, we optimize for serving the emergent needs of users, instead of planning and executing an architecture that cannot respond to those changing needs.

8.  **Deliver incremental value.** We deliver value to users as often as possible.

9.  **Rely on DevSecOps.** This allows us to rapidly develop and deploy improvements to our systems, infrastructure-as-code, configuration-as-code, and CI/CD, to ensure that our work is high-quality and secure.

10. **Embrace and drive change.** We recognize that this work requires constant learning on the part of all participants, and embrace the state of not-knowing that must precede learning.
