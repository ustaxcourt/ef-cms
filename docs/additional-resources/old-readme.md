# Electronic Filing / Case Management System (DAWSON)

## Overview

**The [United States Tax Court](https://ustaxcourt.gov/)** is an independent Federal court that provides a forum for settling disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service. There are approximately 200 employees at the Court and they handle approximately 60,000 petitions each year. About 60% of these petitions are filed from people without lawyers.

**DAWSON (Docket Access Within a Secure Online Network)** is the U.S. Tax Court's open source electronic filing and case management system, available in this repository. It was [named after a beloved Judge](https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/dawson.html) that kept meticulous records.

**Flexion** is the competitively awarded contractor that has been working on DAWSON since 2018. **18F** is a federal digital service team serving as advisors to the U.S. Tx Court and have paired with the U.S. Tax Court since the inception of DAWSON.

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io//test/github/flexion/ef-cms/badge.svg?targetFile=package.json)](https://snyk.io//test/github/flexion/ef-cms?targetFile=package.json)

The fork of this project in which the bulk of development is occurring is [Flexionâ€™s fork](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms), but all changes are pulled into the U.S. Tax Courtâ€™s repository every two weeks.

This is a React-based JavaScript application. Itâ€™s housed in a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains the front end (`web-client/`) and the back end (`web-api/`), with a third project housing resources that are shared between the front and back ends (`shared/`). Itâ€™s architected for Amazon Web Services, with a strong reliance on [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), scripted with Terraform. The project is heavily containerized, using Docker, and can be run locally, despite the serverless architecture. Deployment is done via CircleCI.

### Local development

#### Testing everything

To exercise the CI/CD pipeline locally, run the following:

```sh
./docker-test-all.sh
```

This will run the linter, Shellcheck, audit, build, test, Cypress, Cerebral tests, Pa11y, etc. over all the components.

#### Running / verifying the project via Docker

Once [you have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), the following command will spin up a Docker container with the UI, API, local S3, local Dynamo, etc. all running inside it:

```sh
./docker-run.sh
```

- You can access the UI at http://localhost:1234
- You can access the public UI at http://localhost:5678
- You can access the API at http://localhost:4000
- You can access the DynamoDB admin UI at http://localhost:8001
- You can access S3 local at http://localhost:9000
- You can access the style guide at http://localhost:1234/style-guide

Within Docker, you should allocate 2+ CPUs, 8+ GB of RAM, and 4+ GB of swap. With fewer resources, the software is likely to fail to run with errors that donâ€™t make it obvious what the problem is.

#### ECR

ECR is Amazonâ€™s Docker container registry that holds images for `ef-cms` builds on CircleCI. Currently, images can be managed in the AWS ECR console under the `ef-cms-us-east-1`. If you need to update the Docker image, you can do so (with appropriate permissions) by running `./docker-to-ecr.sh`. This command will build an image per the `Dockerfile` config, tag it as `latest` and push it to the repo in ECR.

#### Running this project locally without Docker

The EF-CMS is comprised of two components: the API and the UI. Both must be run in order to function.

##### Prerequisites

- Node v14.16.0
- npm v6.14.11
- ClamAV v0.101.2 (see Setup below)
- Java 11
- jq

##### Setup

- Install the JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html
For ClamAV, macOS users can do the following:
*(Note: The following steps are unnecessary as clamav is disabled.)*
- ~~`brew install clamav`~~
- ~~`cp /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf`~~
- ~~`sed -ie 's/^Example/#Example/g' /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` (comments out `Example` in the `freshclam.conf` file)~~
- Installing `jq`
  - `brew install jq` for macOS users or visit https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

Both the front-end (`/web-client`) and API (`/web-api`) share code that exists in `/shared`. Before you can run either, you need to run `npm install` inside the top-level directory.

- `npm i`

###### Terminal A

- `npm run start:api`

Other start commands:

- Run `cd web-client && npm run start:client:no-scanner` to start the UI without Dynamsoft (or if you don't have a scanner)
- Run `npm run start:public` to start the UI for the public access portion of the site

###### Terminal B

- `npm run start:client`

#### Login and test users

There are two login mechanisms available â€” the legacy mock login system, and a new one that emulates AWS Cognito.

##### Mock login

You can log in using the following accounts.

###### External Users

```txt
petitioner@example.com
privatepractitioner@example.com
privatePractitioner1 - privatepractitioner4@example.com
irspractitioner@example.com
irsPractitioner1 - irspractitioner4@example.com

```

###### Internal Users

No password is required.

##### AWS Cognito

To use Cognito, start the web client with `npm run dev:cognito` (instead of `npm start`) You can then log in with the following accounts.

###### External Users

```txt
petitioner1@example.com â€“ petitioner5@example.com

For a full list of available users, see [court_users.csv](web-api/court_users.csv).

The password for all accounts is set as an environment variable: `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_PASS`.

#### Editor configuration

##### Atom.io

Install the following for best results:

- https://atom.io/packages/language-javascript-jsx
- https://atom.io/packages/language-groovy
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint
- https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom (enable ESLint and StyleLint integrations in settings)

#### Testing / Coverage Tips

- Run all tests with `npm run test`
- The web client, API, and shared code can be tested with `npm run test:client`, `npm run test:api`, and `npm run test:shared`, respectively
- Tip: When working through a single test, you can run a single test with `jest /path/to/test/file.js` (you may need to `npm -i -g jest`). Additionally, you can use `--watch` and `--coverage` flags to to continually run the specified test on save and provide a coverage report. For example: `jest /path/to/test/file.js --watch --coverage`

Example coverage output:
```
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |                   |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
```
- Stmts: % of statements executed in the code
- Branch: % of control structures (for example, `if` statements) executed in the code
- Funcs: % of functions executed in the code
- Uncovered Line #s: lines not covered by tests

#### Accessibility HTML_CodeSniffer Bookmarklet

The following bookmarklet is useful for running pa11y directly on the page you are viewing.  The following link should have instruction on how to setup and use:

https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/

#### Querying Elasticsearch locally

To query elasticsearch locally, run this docker container

```sh
docker run -p 3030:3030 -d appbaseio/mirage
```

- Open your browser to http://localhost:3030

- Update your `.elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml` to have the following pasted at the bottom:

  ```yml
  http.port: 9200
  http.cors.allow-origin: "/.*/"
  http.cors.enabled: true
  http.cors.allow-headers: X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization
  http.cors.allow-credentials: true
  ```
