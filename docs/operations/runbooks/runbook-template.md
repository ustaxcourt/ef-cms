# Title - The action to take

## Description
A very brief blurb summarizing the action being taken.

## Preqrequisites
- List here any prerequesite steps (e.g. tools setup, configuration, etc.) that are necessary for successfully executing the runbook.

## Steps
1. List the steps in detail required to complete the task. These should contain the minimum necessary detail to complete the task. The person executing the task should have enough information to complete it independently (with the exception of those tasks which require other people to be involved -- make sure that's documented in the steps, too!)
2. Any CLI commands or specific inputs to involved tools should be spelled out here explicitly. The person executing the runbook should be able to copy-paste everything necessary, with the exception of values that are expected to vary run-by-run (e.g., the ID of a user being offboarded).

## Additional Resources
- Optional section
- List here any links to reference or exlanatory material that could be useful / related to the process defined in the runbook
  - e.g. if the process is to "Deactivate a user", you might link to the Cognito docs, or another DAWSON doc page about how we manage users.
