# Environment Shuffle Process

Overall, we want to merge `ustc/staging` to `flexion/staging` and `flexion/staging` to `flexion/develop` as often as possible.

## Specific Steps

1. Back-merge USTC `staging` into Flexion `staging`.

   1. Create a new branch (e.g. `from-courts-staging`) off of `flexion/staging`.
   2. Merge `ustc/staging` into the new branch (e.g. into `from-courts-staging`).
   3. If merge conflicts exist, work with those involved in the conflicting changes.
      For example, on 10/21/21, we merged `ustc/staging` into `flexion/staging`.
      `flexion/staging` had changes from the devex task where moment.js was replaced with luxon.
      However, incoming changes from `ustc/staging` had new work using moment.js format.
      Had to update new code from `ustc/staging` to use luxon format and fix the broken tests.
   4. Create and merge passing PR from current branch (e.g. `from-courts-staging`) to `flexion/staging`.

2. Wait for smoketests to pass on resulting `flexion/staging` build.


3. Prepare Batch PR.

   1. Merge `flexion/staging` to the batch branch (the one currently in a draft state, e.g. batch 10).
      If the draft PR (e.g. batch 10 PR) is still out of date with `ustc/staging`, start this process over at step 1.1.
   2. Mark the draft batch PR (e.g. batch 10 PR) as "Ready For Review" (i.e. convert from draft PR to open PR).

4. Sync Flexion `staging` and Flexion `develop`.

   1. Create a new branch off of `flexion/develop` (e.g. `staging-to-develop`).
   2. Merge `flexion/staging` into the new branch (e.g. into `staging-to-develop`).
   3. If merge conflicts exist, work with those involved in the conflicting changes.
   4. Create and merge passing PR from current branch (e.g. `staging-to-develop`) to `flexion/develop`.
   5. Create a PR to merge `flexion/develop` into `flexion/staging`, so that new batch work (e.g. batch 11) is on `flexion/staging`.

5. Update USTC `migration` with latest batch.

   1. Create a new branch off of `flexion/staging` (e.g. `to-court-migration`).
   2. Create a PR to merge the new branch (e.g. `to-court-migration`) into `ustc/migration`, so that new batch work (e.g. batch 11) is on `ustc/migration` and can be tested with prod like data.
   3. Click the "Update branch" to make the new branch (e.g. `to-court-migration`) up-to-date with `ustc/migration`.
   4. Merge the PR after approvals and the checks pass.
