# Blue-Green Deploy and Migration Steps

![Migration Terraform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1868782/117465361-9f83e400-af1f-11eb-8844-b14fefa2c3d2.png)

Every deployment, whether it's to production or a development environment, is a blue-green deployment. We build a copy for the resources that are required to run a second version of the application. When the copy is ready and tested, we switch the client over to run off of the newly deployed color and have the old color available for rolling back.

Additionally, for deployments that require change in the data schema or broad stroke changes to the database in order for the application to function, we build an empty copy of the data stores (DynamoDB and Elasticsearch). Then we perform a migration of information from the old data store into the newly created one. This migration passes all of the data through a lambda to update and verify the data before saving it into a new data store.

## Automated Migration Steps

This process is mostly automated. For Production (`ENV` would be `prod`), the final `switch-colors` step is manual. For the rest of the environments that step occurs following a successful smoke tests step.

Here are the steps involved:

1. Setup the destination environments.  Load up the `efcms-ENV-deploy` dynamodb table and figure out the destination version.  If `source-table-version` is `beta`, you would need to delete the `efcms-ENV-alpha` DynamoDB tables (east and west!) as well as the `efcms-search-ENV-alpha` Elasticsearch Cluster, and vice versa.

    - delete the efcms-ENV-VERSION on east-1 and west-1
    - delete the efcms-search-ENV-VERSION elasticsearch cluster

    **NOTE:** if you encounter an error trying to delete the DynamoDB table due to a 24-hour restriction, try deleting the `west` table before the `east` table.

2. Run a circle deploy

3. Monitor and wait for elasticsearch to no longer have much indexing activity to know when the re-indexing is done.

4. (on prod only) verify the destination color seems ok (manually test)

5. (on prod only) Ensure you have the proper environmental variables set:
   - `ENV`: The environment receiving the migration
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: The aws account id
   - `CURRENT_COLOR`: The current color we are on
   - `DEPLOYING_COLOR`: The color we are deploying to
   - `EFCMS_DOMAIN`: The Domain for the environment (e.g., `mig.ef-cms.ustaxcourt.gov`)
   - `ZONE_NAME`: The Hosted Zone for the install (e.g., `ef-cms.ustaxcourt.gov`)
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS credentials
   - `AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS credentials

6. (on prod only) When you are ready to accept the deployment, perform the following command to switch the colors:

    ```bash
    npm run switch-colors -- $ENV

7. Finally, destroy the Migration infrastructure (the SQS queues):

    ```bash
    npm run destroy:migration -- ${ENV}

    ```

## Manual Migration Steps

The application kicks off a migration automatically if it detects migrations that need to be run in the codebase that haven't yet been run upon that environment. In order to force a migration, perform the following manual steps in order to kick off a blue-green migration. This is used most often to perform a complete re-index of information into Elasticsearch.

1. Change the `destination-table-version` to the alternate of `alpha` or `beta` depending on whatever the `source-table-version` is in the `efcms-ENV-deploy` table. For instance, if the application is currently running on `alpha`, both the `source-table-version` and `destination-table-version` would be `alpha`. In this case, change the `destination-table-version` to `beta`.
2. Change the value of the database record with the key of `migrate` to `true`. The system will automatically change this back to `false` after completing the migration.
3. Perform the steps above for an [automated migration](#automated-migration-steps).

## First Time Deployment

If this is the first time running a blue/green deployment on the environment:

1. Ensure you have `COGNITO_SUFFIX` environment variables properly set
2. Run `npm run deploy:account-specific` if it has not already been run for the account.
3. Ensure you have `ZONE_NAME` and `EFCMS_DOMAIN` environment variables properly set
4. Run `npm run deploy:environment-specific <ENV>`
5. Delete the environment's lambda S3 bucket and 4 UI S3 buckets:
   - `<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>.<ENV>.us-east-1.lambdas`
   - `app.<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>`,
   - `<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>`,
   - `app-failover.<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>`,
   - `failover.<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>`, and
6. Attempt to run a deploy on circle. The deploy will fail on the deploy web-api terraform step. In order to resolve the error, run:
   -  `./setup-s3-deploy-files.sh <ENV>`
   -  `./setup-s3-maintenance-file.sh <ENV>`
7. Run the following command to set the environment's migrate flag to **true**:
    ```aws dynamodb put-item --region us-east-1 --table-name "efcms-deploy-${ENV}" --item '{"pk":{"S":"migrate"},"sk":{"S":"migrate"},"current":{"S":"true"}}'```
8. Run the following command to set the environment's initial version (`${VERSION}` being the current version of the migrations, which you can tell in [this terraform file](web-api/terraform/template/main.tf)):
    ```aws dynamodb put-item --region us-east-1 --table-name "efcms-deploy-${ENV}" --item '{"pk":{"S":"destination-table-version"},"sk":{"S":"destination-table-version"},"current":{"S":"${VERSION}"}}'```
9. Run the following command to set the environment's migrate flag to **false** (for next time):
    ```aws dynamodb put-item --region us-east-1 --table-name "efcms-deploy-${ENV}" --item '{"pk":{"S":"migrate"},"sk":{"S":"migrate"},"current":{"S":"false"}}'```
10. Run the following command to set the environment's maintenance-mode flag to **false**:
    ```aws dynamodb put-item --region us-east-1 --table-name "efcms-deploy-${ENV}" --item '{"pk":{"S":"maintenance-mode"},"sk":{"S":"maintenance-mode"},"current":{"BOOL": false}}'```
11. Run the SES verification script for this environment (view the script and ensure your environment variables are configured correctly):
    ```./web-api/verify-ses-email.sh```
12. Run the switch colors script to configure the top-level DNS records appropriately (view the script and ensure your environment variables are configured correctly):
    ```./web-client/switch-colors.sh```


## If a Migration is not necessary

1. Run the following command to set the environment's migrate flag to **false**:
    ```aws dynamodb put-item --region us-east-1 --table-name "efcms-deploy-${ENV}" --item '{"pk":{"S":"migrate"},"sk":{"S":"migrate"},"current":{"S":"false"}}'```

## If a new DynamoDB table and Elasticsearch domain is necessary

If a new dynamo table and elasticsearch domain is necessary, duplicate the modules found in `web-api/terraform/template/main.tf`. Be sure to update the version number at the end of the module names, `table_name`, and `domain_name`. Do not delete the old modules. Add the modules to `depends_on` in `main-east.tf` and `main-west.tf`

1. Run a deploy in circle.
2. Verify the new application works at:
   - https://<DEPLOYED_COLOR>-<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>
   - https://app-<DEPLOYED_COLOR>.<ENV>.<ZONE_NAME>
3. Destroy the migration infrastructure to turn off the live streams
   `DESTINATION_TABLE=b SOURCE_TABLE=a STREAM_ARN=abc npm run destroy:migration -- <DEPLOYED_ENV>`

## Deploying to Prod

You will have to manually run `switch-colors.sh`. Before you run, set the following values:
   ENV=prod
   EFCMS_DOMAIN=dawson.flexion.us
   ZONE_NAME=dawson.flexion.us

Ensure you have DEPLOYING_COLOR and CURRENT_COLOR set to appropriate values in your local environment.

## Errors You May Encounter

### AWS-related

#### Route53 Error

```
Error: [ERR]: Error building changeset: InvalidChangeBatch: [Tried to create resource record set [name='_243f260ea635a6dffe0db2c6cc1c1158.*************************.', type='CNAME'] but it already exists]
```
Manually delete the Route53 record and rerun the deploy.


#### IAM Role already exists

```
Error: Error creating IAM Role migration_role_<ENV>: EntityAlreadyExists: Role with name 		migration_role_<ENV> already exists.
	status code: 409, request id: ***********

  on migration.tf line 1, in resource "aws_iam_role" "migration_role":
   1: resource "aws_iam_role" "migration_role" {
```

Delete the role in the AWS IAM console and rerun `npm run deploy:environment-specific <ENV>`.

#### Failing smoke tests

When this is run for the first time on a new environment, the smoke tests may fail for up to an hour after the initial deploy due to the header security lambda redeploying to all edge locations. To resolve, wait an hour and rerun the smoke tests.

#### 403 on websockets endpoint

If the websockets endpoint returns a 403 Unauthorized error (can be seen during trial session smoke tests), redeploy the websocket APIs for the environment in the AWS console under API Gateway (both east and west).
