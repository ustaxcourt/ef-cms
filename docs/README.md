# The Dawson Documentation

The goal for this documentation is to consolidate all of the various forms of documentation we have for this project into a single easy to navigate website. This documentation is supposed to be setup as an onboarding guide for new users, and as a reference for existing users.  We should strive to have it read like a book that introduces the various concepts of Dawson in an incremental approach.  Avoid making our documentation a dumping ground, but instead keep it a teaching instrument.

?> If you have a random piece of documentation that doesn't necessarily flow well into this documentation, you can put it in the [Additional Resources](/additional-resources/README) section and link to it from the appropriate section.

## How to Contribute to this Documentation?

The documentation is built using the open source tool [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).

You can learn how to customize the theme for these docs [here](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/customization?id=sidebar).

To contribute to this documentation, you can run `npm run docs` which will preview the documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and live reload as you change the .md files.  Change the `docsify/**/*` files as needed.

?> Please run images through [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) before uploading to the repo to keep them optimized. Our repo is already bloated enough.

?> Anyone on the team is welcome to contribute to this documentation ✏️

## Where to Start?

If you are brand new to this project, we recommend trying to read through this readme in sequential order.  Each part of the documentation attempts to build upon the last to ease the learning experience.  There is a lot to this system, so the goal is to learn a little bit at a time.

If you're ready for the challenge, navigate to the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) and start learning about Dawson.

Otherwise, if you're just interested in a particular topic, you can find it in the sidebar.

## Onboarding Resources

The onboarding checklist and quick reference guide will be handy as you navigate your first couple months. Please reach out to your onboarding buddy with questions. If you don't have a buddy and want one, please ask the team about it!

1. [Onboarding Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12twlx5nLG6B4R6ds96wh_gZ6wR5Y_PGjsmSeP98V6o0): Make a copy as this will be your personal checklist of important tasks as you onboard
2. [Onboarding Quick Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ObraR8X5YUzR1GIwsm903EhS7-AQbpy90--5aAWysKU): A hodge-podge of helpful links, information, who's who, what's what

## Looking for Old Docs?

Most of the older documentation was moved directly into this docsify directory.  The goal is to eventually incorporate them into the top level sections of this documentation, or move them to a common sub directory if they don't fit well into the incremental introduction approach the documentation is attempting to follow. They can be found on one of the following links:

- [Additional Resources](/additional-resources/README)
- [Operations](/operations/README)
- [Environments](/environments/README)
- [Flow](/flows/README)
- [Architecture](/architecture/README)
