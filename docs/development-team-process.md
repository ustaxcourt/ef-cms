# Development Team Process

* Typically engineering makes code changes for one story at a time.
* Before starting a story, we’ll review the design with the team and create an initial task list. The views and task list may change as we learn more.
* Check Style guide for common components. If something isn't there, create it.
* All tasks will be listed in story description, including bugs.
* Split tasks into view, presenter, use cases, entities, lambdas, integration, etc. so that we can work on the same story without creating merge conflicts.
* Each dev claims one task at a time. Multiple names can be on the same task if we’re pairing.
* Create a PR for every task, tests included.
* Mark tasks as PRed when a PR is created.
* Check the box for the task after a successful merge to develop.
* When you finish a task, claim a new one. If you have any questions, ping the group in Slack.
