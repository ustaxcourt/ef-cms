# Sensitive Data

DAWSON handles sensitive user data including taxpayer PII. We use an open-source model for development and our two repos, however this data should never be available publicly. Avoid committing real user data to this codebase (i.e. PII in seed data in `efcms-local`). Use a high degree of discretion when posting information about DAWSON in publicly accessible channels such as Github/Zenhub.
