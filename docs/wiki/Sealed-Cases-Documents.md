# Sealed Cases and Documents

## Sealed Cases
* Docket clerk / clerk of court roles only have access to seal a case
* Once a case is sealed, it cannot be unsealed

### Searching for sealed cases
**Case Search**
* Sealed cases are not visible in public search by name; will receive "No matching results"
* Sealed cases are visible by public docket number search - display docket number only and no additional case information

**Order Search**
* Orders from sealed cases appear in internal order search results but do not display in public search results

**Opinion Search**
* Opinions from sealed cases appear in internal and public search results


## Sealed Documents 
* Documents that were sealed in Blackstone (LegacySealed) display on the Docket Record with a lock icon
* LegacySealed documents are visible only to court users and are not hyperlinked for parties to the case
* If a document is LegacySealed, the entire case is sealed (to change post-MVP)
