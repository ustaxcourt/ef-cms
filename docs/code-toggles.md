# Code Toggle Process

* All new GitHub issues have code toggles created.
* Toggles are left on so that they can be verified by Flexion QA.
* When making a Sprint PR, any Github issue that has not yet passed QA will have the toggle turned off.
* When the court QAs a Github issue and closes the issue, Flexion removes the toggle in our develop branch.
