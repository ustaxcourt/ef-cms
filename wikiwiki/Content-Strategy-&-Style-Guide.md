# Voice & Tone

When communicating to the public, we want to maintain a friendly, direct tone. Break things down into pieces and steps as much as possible. Simplify legalese into more plain language and known terminology, except when law or Court policies dictate specific language must be used.

Use plain language for error messages, alerts, and instructions so users can clearly understand what is happening.

# Style Guide

- Generally follows AP style
- Use Title case for headers (all)
- (**Exception**) - Use sentence case for headers in page-level success/alert/error messages.
- Use sentence case for field labels and any other body copy content (all)
- (**Exception**) - Use title case for document type and document titles
- Use Title case for buttons
- Use MM/DD/YY for dates
- (**Exception**) - If date is part of concatenated document title, date is MM-DD-YYYY
- Use contractions whenever possible
- Spell out "number" or use "No" as abbreviation
- Use serial/Oxford commas
- Display dollar amounts with decimals ($60.00)
- Time displayed as 3:45 pm ET
- Error messages should be clear directions/verb phrases of what the user needs to do e.g., "Enter state" or "Select trial city" without periods at the end

# Success and error messages

* Always appear at the top of the screen, under the Case detail page header (docket number) with user always scrolled back to the top
* Include summary of what's happened as well as instructions or messages about what to do next
* All success and error messages have the manual "dismiss" action EXCEPT validation errors, which disappear after the action has been re-tried and no more errors exist
