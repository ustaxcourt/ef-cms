## Setting a Case for Trial
### QC of Eligible Cases
* Cases with the status of "General Docket (At Issue) - Ready for Trial" with no blocks or pending items, will be included in the list of Eligible Cases for an existing trial session in the requested trial location
* L and P case types get prioritized before any other type of case; and then sequentially based upon the date petition was filed (FIFO)
* Petitions/Calendar clerk must QC cases before they are set for trial and check the "QC Complete" checkbox on the trial session eligible case list
* When trial session is set (calendared) - eligible cases that have QC checked will be set for trial, in priority order, until they reach the max number of cases for that session

#### Bulk Generation of Notices
* When the trial session is set, all eligible cases added to that session are issued a Notice Setting Case for Trial and a Standing Pre-Trial Order (Regular cases) or Standing Pre-Trial Notice (Small cases)
* If any cases added include paper service, the clerk is directed to Print Paper Service documents; for printing purposes, the Notice Setting Case for Trial and Standing Pre-Trial Order/Notice are combined for each case
* The Notice Setting Case for Trial displays on the Docket Record for each case added to the trial session
* The Standing Pre-Trial Order or Standing Pre-Trial Notice displays on the Docket Record for each case added to the trial session

### Manually Add a Case to an Open Trial Session
* User manually adds a case to a trial session that is already set
* Case appears in Open Cases, but does not impact any other cases on the trial session
* Can be added to a case in the requested trial location OR any trial location
* When added, a Notice Setting Case for Trial and a Standing Pre-Trial Order (Regular cases) or Standing Pre-Trial Notice (Small cases) is generated and add to the Docket Record

### Manually Add Case to a New Trial Session
* User selects which existing trial session they want the case to be added to
* Case is added with priority to the Eligible List for the selected trial session
* Can be added to a case in the requested trial location OR any trial location
* When the calendar is set for this trial session, this case will be set for trial, and a Notice Setting Case for Trial and a Standing Pre-Trial Order (Regular cases) or Standing Pre-Trial Notice (Small cases) is generated and add to the Docket Record  

### Set Case as High Priority for Next Available New Trial Session
* Used to be called "white carding"
* User manually sets case as "high priority"
* If a trial session with status New exists for the requested trial location, case is added with priority to the Eligible List for the next available trial session
* If no trial session with status New exists for the requested trial location, case will be added to eligible case list when the trial session is created
