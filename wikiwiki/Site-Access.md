# Accessibility
* Public-facing pages will be optimized for smaller screens and be fully accessible (tested with screen readers, keyboard navigation, etc)
* Public-facing pages that are loaded in non-Chrome browsers will see a message that the system is optimized for Chrome and to switch to that browser if possible
* Internal Court pages will not be tested on smaller screens as their access is limited to laptops or desktops and will only be minimally tested for full accessibility (de-prioritized due to shortened timeframe for MVP)
* Internal Court pages will be optimized only for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as internal users will be told to access it this way (to eliminate timely cross-browser testing for MVP)
