          <span className="text-underline text-bold">
            Communication Between the Parties
          </span>
          . The parties must begin discussing settlement and/or preparation of a
          stipulation of facts (facts on which the parties agree) as soon as
          possible. All minor issues should be settled so that the Judge can
          focus on the issue(s) needing a decision. Some cases may be
          susceptible to partial or full settlement, and the Court expects the
          parties to negotiate in good faith with this goal in mind. If a party
          has trouble communicating with another party or complying with this
          Order, that party should inform the Judge right away by filing a
          Status Report or requesting a conference call by calling the
          Judge&apos;s chambers at the phone number listed below.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-underline text-bold">Language Barriers</span>.
          All Court proceedings are conducted in English. All documents must be
          filed in English or include a certified English translation. You
          should let the Judge know as early as possible if you require help
          with English. It is generally the responsibility of each petitioner to
          bring an interpreter. If you give advance notice, the Court may have
          one available.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-underline text-bold">Sanctions</span>. The Court
          may impose appropriate sanctions, including dismissal, for any
          unexcused failure to comply with this or other Court orders. See Rule
          131(b), Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure (available at{' '}
          <a href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov">www.ustaxcourt.gov</a>).{' '}
          <span className="text-bold">
            If you have not settled your case and you do not participate in
            conference calls and pretrial conferences, or appear at trial, the
            Judge may dismiss your case and enter a decision against you.{' '}

          Any failures may also be considered in relation to sanctions against

                must appear before the Judge as instructed in the Notice Setting

                tips, can be found on the Court&apos;s website{' '}
                <a href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov">www.ustaxcourt.gov</a>. A
                personal Zoom account is not required, and there is no cost to
                the parties. The parties are responsible for ensuring, to the
                best of their abilities, that they and their witnesses have
                adequate technology and internet resources to participate. The
                parties should log on and test their connections at least 30
                minutes before a remote proceeding is scheduled to begin.

                the Court may schedule a specific date and time for the trial.
                The parties may also jointly contact the Judge’s chambers to
                request a specific date and time for the trial. If practicable,
                the Court will attempt to accommodate the request, keeping in
                mind other scheduling requirements and the anticipated length of
                the session. Parties should jointly inform the Judge as early as
                possible if they expect trial to require 3 days or more.
