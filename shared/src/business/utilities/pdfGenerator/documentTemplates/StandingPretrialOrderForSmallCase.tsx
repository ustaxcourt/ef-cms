            The U.S. Tax Court hears disputes between taxpayers (petitioners)
            and the IRS (respondent). The Court is independent of, and not
            affiliated with, the IRS. Documents previously given to the IRS are
            not part of the record in this case and may not be considered unless

              Contact Information

              Communication Between the Parties
            </span>
            . The parties must begin discussing settlement and/or preparation of
            a stipulation of facts (facts on which the parties agree) as soon as
            possible. All minor issues should be settled so that the Judge can
            focus on the issue(s) needing a decision. Some cases may be
            susceptible to partial or full settlement, and the Court expects the
            parties to negotiate in good faith with this goal in mind. If a
            party has trouble communicating with another party or complying with
            this Order, that party should tell the Judge right away by filing a
            Status Report or requesting a conference call by calling the Judge’s
            chambers at the phone number listed below.

            should let the Judge know as early as possible if you require help
            with English. It is generally the responsibility of each petitioner
            to bring an interpreter. If you give advance notice, the Court may
            have one available.

            number listed below) as early as possible and before the first day

              Remote Proceeding Access
            </span>
            . If a remote proceeding is scheduled in your case, the parties must
            appear before the Judge as instructed in the Notice Setting Case for
            Trial. Information on how to use Zoomgov, including tips, can be
            found on the Court’s website,{' '}
            <a href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov">www.ustaxcourt.gov</a>. A
            personal Zoom account is not required, and there is no cost to the
            parties. The parties are responsible for ensuring, to the best of
            their abilities, that they and their witnesses have adequate
            technology and internet resources to participate. The parties should
            log on and test their connections at least 30 minutes before a
            remote proceeding is scheduled to begin.

            <span className="text-underline text-bold">Time of Trial</span>. All
            parties <b>must</b> be prepared for trial at any time during the
            trial session unless a specific date and time has been previously
            set by the Court. After Pretrial Memoranda are filed, the Court may
            schedule a specific date and time for the trial. The parties may
            also jointly contact the Judge’s chambers to request a specific date
            and time for the trial. If practicable, the Court will attempt to
            accommodate the request, keeping in mind other scheduling
            requirements and the anticipated length of the session. The parties
            and any witnesses must be ready to participate at the time the trial
            starts. Testimony given by you or your witnesses during the trial is
            considered evidence.
