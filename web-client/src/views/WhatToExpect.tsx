      To file a case with the Tax Court, you’ll need to submit the following
      items that can be prepared in advance. Once you start a case, you
      won&apos;t be able to save your work and come back to it. After the case
      has been processed, you&apos;ll be able to log in at any time to view the
      status and take action on the case.
