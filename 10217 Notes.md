UX 


Engineering bugs
- [x] caseServicesSupervisors can't click on STIN file when qcing
- [ ] as a petitioner, password protected IRS notice shows the wrong modal 
- [ ] new upload component: Remove File link persists after file is removed by clicking Cancel in the file selector


Validation/TODOs
- [ ] What should the validation message for ATP files in `shared/src/business/entities/cases/ElectronicPetition.ts`
- [ ] How do we validate the file size in Electronic Petition? Its an array so how will that work?
    - Right now, we can validate against the number of files but not the size of each file in the array.
- [ ] write smoketests to add ATPs when creating cases
- [ ] CYPRESS test integration (cover the whole flow)
