# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a U.S. Tax Court open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask â€” or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).
